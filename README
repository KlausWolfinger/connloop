connloop: An IPv4/6 TCP connection tester/flooder.

This program lets you run TCP connectivity testing towards IPv4 and
IPv6 targets. Detailed control over connection timeout lets you
determine if a service is slow to respond, possibly due to overload or
backend problems filling up the available resources.
